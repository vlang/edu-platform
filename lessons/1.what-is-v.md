What is V
=========

V is a [general purpose programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language).
This means it can be used to create any type of program you desire, rather than being focused on
any one particular type of program.

V is also a statically typed, compiled langauge.  Statically typed means that
all variable types are known at compile time, and cannot change type at runtime.

In other words, if you create a string variable, it will always be a string
variable, and cannot be changed to an integer without changing the source and
recompiling your program.

You can install V by [following the instructions here](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/README.md#installing-v-from-source).
