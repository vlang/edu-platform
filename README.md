# Educational Materials for V

This repo will house lessons and other materials to help learn and use the
[V](https://vlang.io) Programming Language.

## Usage

Besides simply reading or viewing the available materials, this repo also
includes a small web server written in V in the `main.v` file at the root
of the project.

You can use this server to view the files in your browser if you have the
V language installed locally, by running this command:
```sh
v run main.v
```
When the server is intialized, it will print the URL to open in your browser to look through these materials.
